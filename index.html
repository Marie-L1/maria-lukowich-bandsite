            <h3 class="about__title">The Bees Knees</h3>
            <p class="about__content">The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco, California. The band 
                                    consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead 
                                    vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a keyboardist and a 
                                    drummer. The band achieved its first commercial success as an 
                                    unsigned act, drawing attention from their 
                                    future manager. Having extensive experience 
                                    working with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was confident the band could 
                                    succeed even further with more support, pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well 
                                    known record label.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="about__content">From there, the band has soared, gaining 
                                international recognition and ranking in the 
                                top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans 
                                immediately fell in love with the band’s original 
                                and organic attitude, solidifying their place as 
                                one of the hottest and fastest up and coming 
                                acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to 
                                themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to 
                                their candid and authentic performances on 
                                stage. The Bees Knees are currently recording 
                                their second studio album, looking to be released in early 2024.</p>
